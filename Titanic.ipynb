    "- **Age Distribution:** The majority of passengers were young adults, with a notable number of children and elderly.\n",
    "- **Survival by Age:** Younger passengers, especially children, had a higher survival rate.\n",
    "- **Gender and Survival:** Females had a significantly higher chance of survival compared to males.\n",
    "- **Class and Survival:** Passengers in 1st and 2nd class were more likely to survive than those in 3rd class.\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis:** Survival is positively correlated with being female and being in a higher class, and negatively correlated with age and fare for some groups.\n",
