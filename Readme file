# Titanic EDA — Data Analyst Internship Task 5

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship and involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📁 Project Structure

📦 Titanic_EDA/
├── Titanic.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA
├── Titanic.csv # Dataset (Titanic training data)
├── Titanic Train.py # Script version of the notebook (optional)
├── EDA_Report.pdf # Exported PDF report from the notebook
└── README.md # Project documentation


## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore the Titanic dataset visually and statistically.
- Identify trends and relationships between variables.
- Present insights through charts like histograms, boxplots, countplots, pairplots, and heatmaps.

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Age Distribution:** Majority of passengers were young adults, with many children and some elderly.
- **Survival by Age:** Younger passengers had a higher survival rate.
- **Gender Impact:** Females had a significantly higher chance of survival.
- **Class Factor:** 1st and 2nd class passengers were more likely to survive than 3rd class.
- **Correlation:** Positive correlation between survival and being female or in a higher class.

## 📄 Deliverables

- `Titanic.ipynb`: Contains all EDA code, visuals, and written insights.
- `EDA_Report.pdf`: PDF version of the notebook for easy viewing.
- `Titanic.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
